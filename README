For my contribution to GCompris, I have been working on developing a prototype of an activity I plan to develop in greater detail this summer. This activity is listed under the "ideas" page for GCompris (http://gcompris.net/wiki/Ideas_for_activities), and it utilizes the GCompris shape engine. The activities I will create will undoubtedly involve a great deal more detail, but it was very interested and rewarding to begin these activities. I welcome comments as I continue to develop code while learning about GCompris.

The activity description (from Bruno Coudoin's GCompris ideas page)
Object Classification

For young kids, we could create an activity where they must classify object from larger to smaller, and so on. The size classification could be based on the real-life sizes. For example, a car is larger than a light bulb, but the actual images could be equal size.
